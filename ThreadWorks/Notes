Start Vs Run
difference is that when program calls start() method a new Thread is created and code inside run() method is executed in new Thread 
while if you call run() method directly no new Thread is created and code inside run() will execute on current Thread.

Create a Thread
1. Extend the thread class
2. Implement the Runnable Interface
3. Write an inner class for the run method and override.
4. Lambda.

Daemon Thread

1. Always runs in the background
2. Can be marked explicitly.
3. Cannot be marked as a daemon once the thread start() has been invoked.
4. A Daemon thread will be automatically stopped upon the closure of all the other threads (Normal).
